## wamo adapter for ioBroker

This adapter adds "wamo" leakage protection monitoring to your ioBroker installation.

The adapter connects to your **SYR SafeTech Connect 2422** or **POLYGONVATRO** leakage protection device in order to read data from the device and create some statistic data like water consumption history.

[SYR SaveTech Connect 2422](https://www.syr.de/de/Produkte/CB9D9A72-BC51-40CE-840E-73401981A519/SafeTech-Connect)

The POLYGONVATRO unit is, under the hood, a SYR SaveTech Connect 2422 unit but without pressure-, temperature- and conductivity sensor. The POLYGONVATRO unit is currently not available. 

# IMPOTEANT
In the **_Jam Protection_** release a scheduled move of the main valve was added and can be activated and scheduled in the adapter settings area (Tab: Tasks)

Be verry careful with this functionality because it will **_close_** and **_open_** the main valve in order to prevent it to get stuck in open position and therefore will not close in case of an leakage.

The **_Jam Protection_** can be planed using a CRON schedule which will also be configured in the adapter settings **_Tasks_** tab.
Be verry careful there as well, because if you schedule a jam protection for example every 1 Minute you are having big trouble because your main valve will close and open every minute!

During the **_Jam Protection_** activity, no regular states (Valve, Alarms etc.) will be updated in order to prevent false trigger you may have set on of those states.

If the main valve is already in **_closed_** position, the **_Jam Protection_** activity will not be performed in order to prevent opening the main valve.

### Disclaimer / Warning
If during the **_Jam Protection_** activity communication to the device gets lost or the WAMO adapter or ioBroker itself crashes or will be stopped, the main valve will stay in the last commanded position! This means if something gets wrong, the valve could be closed and needs to be opened by yourself using the related app or the button on the device itself.
