## wamo adapter for ioBroker

This adapter adds "wamo" leakage protection monitoring to your ioBroker installation.

The adapter connects to your **SYR SafeTech Connect 2422** or **POLYGONVATRO** leakage protection device in order to read data from the device and create some statistic data like water consumption history.

SYR SaveTech Connect 2422: https://www.syr.de/de/Produkte/CB9D9A72-BC51-40CE-840E-73401981A519/SafeTech-Connect
The POLYGONVATRO unit is,under the hood, a SYR SaveTech Connect 2422 unit but without pressure- temperature- and conductivity sensor. The POLYGONVATRO unit is currently not available.
