## wamo adapter for ioBroker

This adapter adds "wamo" leakage protection monitoring to your ioBroker installation.

The adapter connects to your **SYR SafeTech Connect 2422** or **POLYGONVATRO** leakage protection device in order to read data from the device and create some statistic data like water consumption history.
